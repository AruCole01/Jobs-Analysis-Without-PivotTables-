# 📊 Job Data Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

This project explores job market data using Excel to uncover insights on roles, salaries, job platforms, remote work trends, and skill demands — all presented in a semi-interactive dashboard** with dropdown filters for Job Title, Country, and Job Type.

## 🧠 What I Did

- Cleaned and structured raw job data
- Built an interactive Excel dashboard using **Tables** and formulas
- Created dropdowns to filter insights dynamically
- Analyzed:
  - Salary ranges across roles
  - Job postings by month
  - Remote vs onsite jobs
  - Job platforms and requirements
  - Skills in demand globally

## 🔍 What I Learned

While Tables in Excel were useful for filtering and dynamic references, I quickly noticed their limitations:

- No easy way to group or summarize data without manual formulas  
- Charts require extra setup and don't update intuitively  
- Scalability and analysis were difficult with growing data

This project helped me realize the **power gap** between regular Tables and **PivotTables + PivotCharts**.
